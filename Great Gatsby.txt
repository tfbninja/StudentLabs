Themes:
Past v Present
Unrequited love
Fantasy v Reality / Unattainable and idealistic goals
Class disparity
Fact v Fiction
Hollowness
The unnstoppable force of time

Lessons:
The past has a place, it's part of us, without it we would be unimaginably different, but it is not the most important thing. It already happened (i.e. you can't change it) You can change right now, which will soon become the past (an unchangeable event)

Fantasy is only practically useful in helping shape how we interact with reality and passing the time.

Questions:
Why couldn't Gatsby accept reality and realize that Daisy was a dead end / out of his league / unprobable before?
